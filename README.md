# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Built supervised ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions on an imbalanced dataset.  Improved detection accuracy by applying feature engineering, preprocessing, and model evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, F1-score).  Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.
